Insights:

DATE: The 'DATE' column contains values for dates, and the mean date seems to be approximately 43,464. From roughly 43,282 to 43,646 is the range of dates. Store numbers are shown in the 'STORE_NBR' column. There are between 1 and 272 stores, with a median of about 135. LYLTY_CARD_NBR: The numbers from loyalty cards are found in the 'LYLTY_CARD_NBR' column. With a mean value of about 135,550, the loyalty card numbers seem to be quite large. Transaction IDs are represented in the 'TXN_ID' column. With a range of 1 to 2,415,841, the average transaction ID is approximately 135,158. PROD_NBR: The 'PROD_NBR' field lists product numbers. Between 1 and 114, there are on average 56 different products. PROD_QTY: The 'PROD_QTY' column represents the quantity of products purchased per transaction. The average quantity is about 1.91, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 200. The standard deviation is relatively low, indicating that most transactions involve purchasing only a few products. TOT_SALES: The 'TOT_SALES' column represents the total sales amount per transaction. The average total sales amount is around 7.30, ranging from 1.50 to 650.00. The standard deviation suggests some variability in sales amounts, with most transactions falling between 5.40 and 9.20.
